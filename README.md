pyDaemon
=========

pyDaemon is a project in which you will find the Daemon class, this class
makes your code to run as a service in Linux starting it as a process in the
system (running in background, no matter if you close the shell). With your
script extending the Daemon class you will be able to: Start, Stop and Restart
the service.

The Daemon class is based on [A simple unix/linux daemon in Python] by Sander
Marechal , my contributions are next: I made it work in python3 , added PEP8
Standards, commented code and modified/add/delete code.

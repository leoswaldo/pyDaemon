pyDaemon
=========

pyDaemon is a project in which you will find the Daemon class, this class
makes your code to run as a service in Linux starting it as a process in the
system (running in background, no matter if you close the shell). With your
script extending the Daemon class you will be able to: Start, Stop and Restart
the service.

The Daemon class is based on
www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python/ , my
contributions are next: I made it work in python3 , added som PEP8 Standards,
commented code and modified/add/delete code.
